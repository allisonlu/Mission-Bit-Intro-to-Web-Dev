	<h1>About</h1>
	<p><strong>Mission Bit</strong> is a non-profit that offers free programming classes to San Francisco public school students. We're focused on <strong>project based learning</strong> and aim to teach <em>both</em> core <em>computer science concepts as well as the practical skills</em> and technologies that are required to build web sites and applications today.</p>

	<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>50% of SFUSD schools do not offer CS classes.</li>
		<li>There is a high demand for programmers, but there are not enough supply of CS graduates.</li>
		<li>Many skilled programmers would love to teach, but need an organization like Mission Bit to make it feasible.</li>
	</ul>
